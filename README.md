# Tiktok2Instagram üì∏
## About The Project

<b> What it does: </b>
* Download the source video from a user inputted Tiktok URL. üìô
* Add audio to the Tiktok video from a folder of your audio files. üéµ
* Crop the video to fit the aspect ratio of an instagram post (square by default but you can change this!) üìê
* Output the edited video to a folder of your choice. üì©

<b> Who should use this? </b>
* Of course anyone is free to download and use it, but this program would be particularly useful to anyone who runs a lot of Instagram accounts with content found from tiktok. Instead of manually going to websites to download links and then editing the videos yourself you can simply input the link to the program and it will handle the rest. üòÑ

### Built With

* [Python 3.9.1](https://www.python.org/)
* [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/)
* [TiktokAPI](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api)
